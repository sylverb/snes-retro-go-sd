/*
 * Metadata embedded in an external "core" binary (/cores/<system>.bin) so
 * the launcher can discover classic emulator cores dynamically instead of
 * linking every system into the firmware ELF.
 *
 * This struct is the "header data" block of the generic CORE/CORI
 * container already used by load_core_bin_with_header() (see
 * rg_emulators.c): magic("CORE") + header_version(u16) + header_length(u16)
 * + header_data[header_length] + payload. When header_version ==
 * GNW_CORE_META_VERSION, header_data starts with exactly this struct,
 * followed by the optional pad/header logo blobs (raw retro_logo_image:
 * width(u16) + height(u16) + packed 1bpp rows) for each entry in
 * `systems[]`, referenced by that entry's offset+size pairs (offsets are
 * absolute from the start of the file, so a prober can fseek+fread them
 * directly), followed by the payload bytes for each entry in `segments[]`
 * back to back, in order.
 *
 * v3: a single core binary can now describe UP TO GNW_CORE_MAX_SYSTEMS
 * launcher tabs (e.g. PC Engine HuCard + PC Engine CD from one `pce.bin`,
 * dispatched at runtime by the core itself via ACTIVE_FILE->ext — exactly
 * like the old compile-time build did) and UP TO GNW_CORE_MAX_SEGMENTS
 * independently-loaded code+bss blobs, each targeting a different fixed
 * memory region (see gnw_core_region_t) instead of always landing in
 * RAM_EMU — e.g. PC Engine's CPU-hot code runs from ITCM for performance.
 *
 * Backwards-compat rules mirror gw_firmware_abi_t: only ADD fields inside
 * "reserved" (shrinking it), never reorder/remove/resize existing fields.
 * Bump GNW_CORE_META_VERSION only for an incompatible layout change.
